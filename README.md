### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have just completed the Data Science Bootcamp at Le Wagon in December 2022 after having worked as medical doctor for 4 years. 

I am looking forward to integrating my medical background into data science, and bringing all my skills to practice at a new position as Data Analyst/Data Scientist. 

I am currently open to job opportunities!
